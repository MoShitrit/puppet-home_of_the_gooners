                              Madison Avenue

                      Release date: December 7, 1992

Description:
------------

TrueType and PostScript Type 1 Sans Serif swoopy fonts quite like
Solotype's Advertiser Gothic Light. Hitherto unavailable in electronic
form. Great for brochures, promotional pieces, advertisements, etc. The
slightly art deco look is pleasing to the eye.


Features that make Fonts Ink fonts stand out are:

- Legal. Many, if not most, of the fonts found freely available today are
  hacked, translated versions of legitimate fonts that are unlicensed.
  These fonts are not only illegal to produce, they are by nature poor
  copies which result in poor images. These can usually be identified by
  messages in a hex dump of the font such as "Converted by AllType".

- Handcrafted. Fonts Ink fonts have been (believe me) painstakingly
  crafted for small disk and resource size with resulting printing
  speed. You won't find better anywhere. Full use of composite characters
  has been used.

- Supported. The author, Bob Ostrander, has been on the shareware scene
  since 1983. Any problems you may find will be corrected or your money
  back, guaranteed.

Short descriptions suitable for use on BBSs follow:

                serif font for brochures, promotions, etc.
                ASP Shareware from Bob Ostrander.
                Registration $20 or less.
                Legal, high quality, and supported.
